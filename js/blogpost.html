        <p class="font1">Writing wasn’t always my passion.

            I was too busy with other things, like family, gardening and growing my own food, earning a reliable living
            etc.

            It was initially a whimsy, a hobby, a curiosity to see if I could even do this thing called writing.

            It may have started like that for you too.

            I’d had some intuitive inkling in childhood that I would write and had dared to suggest that and been
            mightily put down, but it was a premonition rather than any intention.

            But then my life changed dramatically, several times, and I started writing, got published a few times and
            thought that was it.

            ‘Not so fast’ said the universe, ‘you have still got some work to do on yourself ‘which led to more changes
            and I stopped writing again because I wanted to run courses based on the books I had written.

            I also fell properly in love.

            So I moved far away from London and the publishers got bought out and suddenly that was over. The best laid
            plans of mice and men, of God laughs when we start to plan the future, not sure which.

            We were left with the rather large Georgian house / retreat centre though and did other things with it
            instead. We did run retreats but never enough to make it a living.

            Seventeen years later, we sold our business, which was also our home, as much because my back had started to
            dis-intergrate from arthritis as anything. And suddenly here I was in a smaller house with a lot less to do
            and a mind that never ceases to throw up endless questions and ideas about life, the universe and
            everything.

            It is funny how dramatically life can change in short spaces of time, but one is directed in such ways and I
            always follow, thus I find myself writing up a storm once more. Only now the subject is my own story,
            memoir, more or less, and how I got to this place in life and what I have learned from that journey. It has
            not been remotely uneventful either. There are still some poetry and short stories in there but I see these
            as sidelines, and no novels.

            .
